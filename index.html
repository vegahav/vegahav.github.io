                    <h3>Bio</h3>
                        <p>My name is Hector Vega and I'm an aspiring software developer based in Northern Virginia where I have lived most of my life. Coming from humble beginnings as the son of two immigrants, I learned the value of hard work, dedication, and gratitude from an early age.</p>
                        <p>Growing up I did not have a lot of exposure to technology due to financial constraints. However, I was always fascinated by technologies of all sorts and I considered myself very fortunate when I was finally be able to immerse myself in it. It was then that I knew I had found my true passion.</p>
                        <p>I pursued my education at James Madison University, where I earned a Bachelor of Science in 2020 in Communication Studies, with a minor in Computer Information Systems. This allowed me to cultivate my technical skills and combine them with my ability to effectively communicate and collaborate with others.</p>
                        <p>Fast forward to today and I am 3 years into working for AWS which has been an incredibly rewarding experience, allowing me to contribute to the critical systems that power businesses and organizations around the globe. Because I thrive in a dynamic environment, I am constantly seeking opportunities to enhance my technical skills and deepen my understanding with various technologies.</p>
                        <p>Thank you again for visiting my portfolio website and I hope my work exceeds your expectations. Please do not hesitate to reach out regarding any questions or inclinations to work together. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
